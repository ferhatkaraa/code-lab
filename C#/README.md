## 📚 Course Exercises

This section contains various small-scale projects developed during lectures, including:

- Basic input/output operations
- Conditional statements and loops
- Methods and modular programming
- Arrays and collections
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals
- Exception handling
- File operations

These exercises helped build a strong foundation in C# and structured programming.

## ♟️ Console-Based Chess Project

### 📌 Overview

One of the major projects in this repository is a fully functional console-based Chess game developed in C#.

The project runs entirely in the terminal and simulates a standard 8x8 chess board.

### ⚙️ Features

- 8x8 chess board rendering in console
- Turn-based system (White / Black)
- Piece movement validation
- Board state updating after each move
- Basic rule enforcement
- Text-based board visualization
- Player input handling via coordinates

---

### 🛠 Technical Implementation

- Written in C#
- Object-Oriented Design
- Classes used for:
  - Board
  - Pieces
  - Game Controller
- Switch-case and condition logic for move validation
- 2D array representation of chess board
